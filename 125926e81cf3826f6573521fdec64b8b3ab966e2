- rel 5
- merge libs to main package (it's all in libdir, so no multilib problems)
- installed more docs and moved all of it to -docs package
- obsolete fam (after 3 years I changed my mind),
    rationale: fam does not support inotify, gamin does;
               some programs rely on extended capabilities provided by gamin (Thunar)
               loss of network support is no big deal, as gamin can monitor NFS mount client side
